#convolutional neural networks
CMPSC 165B Machine Learning Project

Create a machine learning model to predict the Fashion MNIST data set.

To run the app, run the following command in the terminal:
```
python prediction.py
```

The script will check whether a saved model exists. If it does, it skips straight to making predictions on the testing set.

Otherwise, it will load the training data and fit the model.

The model is a 4 layer convolution neural network.
